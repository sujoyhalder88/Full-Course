      <h1>Dog</h1>
      <p>
        The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus
        familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is
        characterized by an upturning tail.
        <b>The dog is derived from an ancient,</b> extinct wolf,[6][7] and the
        modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.[8] The dog was the
        first species to be domesticated,[9][8] by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000
        years ago,[7] before the development of agriculture
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Due to their long association with humans</b>, dogs have expanded to
        a large number of domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to
        thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other
        canids.[11] Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human
        behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study
