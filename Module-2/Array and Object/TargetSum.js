/**
 *  Given an array A with a number x. We need to write a function which takes array A and x as argument and return a pair
	from the array A whose sum is equal to x. If no pair exists then return empty array.
	Example :
	Input: {0,1,2,-2,4,5,6}
	Sum = 5
	Output: {1,4}
	There are many approaches to solve this problem
